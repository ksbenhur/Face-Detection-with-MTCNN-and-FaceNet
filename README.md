# Face-Detection-with-MTCNN-and-FaceNet
The goal of this project is to develop a robust face recognition model using a dataset of photos taken during classes. The focus is on creating a model that can accurately identify and distinguish between students in various classroom settings, lighting, backgrounds, etc. 

We used both track 1(without deep learning) and track 2(With deep learning) methods to implement our face recognition process/model. We were able to achieve high accuracies for track 1 models when compared to performances of models from previous quarters and were also successfully able to implement track 2 which has given our highest accuracy for the provided data set.

In this repository I have provided the deep learning solution using MTCNN and Facenet
